This educational project focuses on developing a backend for an online version of the game "Dixit."
Built using Java and the Spring framework, it handles URL-based requests and lays the foundation for implementing core game functionality.
The project is entirely self-developed and served as a personal learning experience in backend programming.
Currently, it is on pause due to university studies, with some parts, such as user authentication, remaining incomplete.
